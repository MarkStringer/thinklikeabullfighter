#Don't be the Bull

The aim of bullfighting is to encroach on the bull's territory, or get between where the bull is and the area that he has marked out as his territory, and as a result, make him charge.  Of course part of charging is that the bull lowers his head so that he can point his horns at you and commits to the attack. By lowering his head he exposes the top of his neck and shoulders to the attack.

Similar way, if you get drawn and commit to a full-blown attack you are vulnerable.
