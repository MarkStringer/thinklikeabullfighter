## What the Hell is This?

Let's maybe start with with what "Think Like a Bullfighter" (TLABF?) isn't.  It isn't  a self-help book. But it might be a self-self-help book - a self help book that I've written for myself. I'm writing this because this is something that *I* want to get clear in my head, because it's something that I not only want to get clear in my head, but want to actually practice, in my life, to make my life better.

And oh my God please don't think that this is a book about bullfighting, it is certainly NOT a guide to how to fight bulls, in a Spanish arena, or in any other context where you might conside taking on several hundred kilos beef. This is for entertainment purposes only - as they say in the legal disclaimer to some seduction manuals.

Another thing this book isn't is a collection of references to other reading. I was very taken or perhaps stung when I first heard the notion of a "three inch Buddha," a person who merely reads things and then regurgitates these things as their own wisdom.

What this book *is* is a book about the difference between wrestling and fighting. This comes from a story that I heard a long, long time ago about someone interviewing a bullfighter who asked them if the bullfighter if he had to do lots of exercises to improve his strength in anticipation of his bullfights.

"I think you have perhaps misunderstood," said the bullfighter, "I do not wrestle the bull."
