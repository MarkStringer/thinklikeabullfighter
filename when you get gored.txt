#When you Get Gored

If you decide that you're going to fight then sometimes you are going to lose. By deciding to fight (rather than just accidentally getting into a fight) you are deliberately raising the stakes, increasing the risk and disturbing the equilibrium.  And sometimes when you do that, the result is that you're going to end up worse than when you started.

One thing that you should know about a fight is that the minute you know for definite that you're losing and you know that it's safe to do so you should retreat. Use blocking.  Use deception, retire to a safe place.
