#Lots of Goes
You probably won't win your first fight.  You might not win your tenth fight. The only way that you will get better at this is with practice.

But remember that fighting isn't wrestling.  Fighting is deliberately intruding onto someone else's territory (like the bull's) to gain a response.  In bullfighting that response is to get the bull to charge.  In real life that response may be merely to get the bull to acknowledge you, to understand where your territory is, to understand that you have any claim to territory.

When you start to see a bullfight in every occasion when somebody intrudes on your territory, or when there's a conflict over territory between you and someone else, you start to see opportunities for bullfights dozens of times a day.

I had a realisation when I was thinking one morning about the whole thinking like a bullfighter concept on the way to work on the London underground.  The walk to the train station is about a mile and it takes me 20 minutes.  And on the way, there must be a dozen territorial spats.  For example, at the bottom of my road there is a pedestrian crossing.  Actually two, one for the traffic in each direction.  When I get to the second lane - the one heading into the city, there are often cars parked across the crossing.  So that when the signal turns to green for me, I feel enraged.  While the signal is green, this is my space.  They should get out of it.  I feel especially enraged if it's someone who should know better, like a police car, or a bus. That's a potential bullfight, right at the bottom of my road. 

Two hundred yards further on I walk along the bank of the Thames.  It's a path shared between cyclists and pedestrians.  There are signs all along the route to indicate that the cyclists should keep near the river and the pedstrians should walk down the side of the building that borders the path. But nobody neither cyclists nor pedestrians pays attention to that meaning that cyclists rush up silently behind you and could whizz either side.
