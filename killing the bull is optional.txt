#Killing the Bull is Optional

It's not about wrestling the bull, I hope we've established that.  And it's not about killing the bull either. Deciding to fight is about changing your opponent, changingin yourself and definitely about changing your relationship between your opponent and yourself. Imagining every fight as a fight to the death makes you much less likely to fight because you become scared that you'll be killed or obliterated, and also, even if you've fantasized about it many times, you not dislike you opponent enought to obliterate them - or maybe you do and you're scared of what that might mean that you do if you get into a fight situation and see that you're winning.

In the Japanese martial art of Aikido there is the notion of looking after your opponent during and after a fight.  The purpose of fighting your opponent according to Aikido isn't to destroy them, but to look after them and make them safe.

No doubt, in some situations the only way to make your opponent safe is to obliterate them.  The torture victim and political thinker Niccolo Machiavelli discusses very early in his book "The Prince" that when you invade a country you should be absolutely ruthless in destroying prince - and the family - of the losing side.


If we go back to that imaginary, metaphorical bullring (remember that I have no knowledge of any real bullrings) a fight isn't about killing the bull a fight is about invading *some* of the bull's territory and making it either yours or a shared space where you are both allowed to operate.
