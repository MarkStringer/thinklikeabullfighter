#Never Wrestle The Bull
Never wrestle. Fight yes (when you think you've got at least a chance of winning, and the costs of losing aren't totally prohibitive). Run away yes. Obstruct, yes.  Deceive? Yes.

What do I mean by wrestle? I mean throw all your weight and strength full on against the weigth and strength of your oponent. Why not? Well, let's look at the potential outcomes of wrestling.

##You're Weaker Than Your Opponent
If you're weaker than your opponent and you're wrestling, then result is that you're going to get flattened. The experience of getting flattened like this will be far destructive than the experience of getting beaten in a fight that you've picked.  The experience will be much more like getting flattened by a bull.

##You're Stronger Than Your Opponent
So you flattened an opponent who was weaker than you. How do you feel now? You flattened someone who was weaker than you, is that a good feeling? What's the value of flattening people who are weaker than you? Is it the best use of your energy and time? Is the payoff big?  Might you not be better picking selected fights with people who are stronger than you, where you have a smaller chance of winning, but a bigger chance of winning big?

##You're Pretty Much the Same Strength as Your Opponent
This the worst of all, because the battle could go on for a long, long time. If you and your opponent are evenly matched and you wrestle, what ensues will be an exhausting and destructive battle which will ultimately end up in one of the outcomes above.  If you wrestle with someone who's pretty much match with you, the outcome will be that in the end you will lose - and lose badly, or in the end you will win - but still be totally exhausted.
