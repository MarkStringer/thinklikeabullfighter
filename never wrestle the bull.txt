#Never Wrestle The Bull
Never wrestle. Fight yes (when you think you've got at least a chance of winning, and the costs of losing aren't totally prohibitive). Run away yes. Obstruct, yes.  Deceive? Yes.

What do I mean by wrestle? I mean throw all your weight and strength full on against the weigth and strength of your oponent. Why not? Well, let's look at the potential outcomes of wrestling.

##You're Weaker Than Your Opponent
If you're weaker than your opponent and you're wrestling, then result is that you're going to get flattened. The experience of getting flattened like this will be far destructive than the experience of getting beaten in a fight that you've picked.  The experience will be much more like getting flattened by a bull.

##You're Stronger Than Your Opponent
So you flattened an opponent who was weaker than you. How do you feel now?
