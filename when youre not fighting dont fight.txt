#When You're not Fighting - Don't Fight!

Do you ever spend your days - and your (sleepless?) nights arguing with someone who isn't there? Does this help? Not really, does it? 

Well, then, stop doing it. One of the things that happens when you decide when to fight and when not to fight, is that the nature of the time when you're not fighting changes.

When you're not fighting you should be doing one of two things, resting or training.
